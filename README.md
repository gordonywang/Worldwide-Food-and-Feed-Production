# Worldwide-Food-and-Feed-Production
Statistical Graphics Poster Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization

•	Analyzed as team of 4 a dataset of world food/feed production from 1961-2013 with 60+ variables and 21,478 observations through graphics in order to report key insights on poster for public presentation to faculty members. 

•	Applied R’s qgraph package to create network diagrams (25% of project’s graphics) to visualize relationships among top 10 producers of top produced food cereal and among top 10 producers of top produced feed milk in terms of partial correlations among each countries’ trend in yearly production totals. (I only used 10 countries for each network diagram due to poster's size constraint.) 

• The objective of my graphics was to ask: "Do correlations between countries' food/feed production reveal any meaningful relationships?"



• Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production or by downloading FAO.csv directly above, which is necessary to run the code.

•	The network diagrams are contained in the files milk_network_diagram.png and cereal_network_diagram.png above.

• The final poster that our team presented is in the PDF file titled "Final Poster - Worldwide Food and Feed Production".
