# Worldwide-Food-and-Feed-Production
Statistical Graphics Poster Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization | Spring 2018

•	Analyzed as team of 4 a dataset of world food/feed production from 1961-2013 with 60+ variables and 21,478 observations through graphics in order to report key insights on poster for public presentation to faculty members. 

•	Applied R’s qgraph package to create network diagrams (25% of project’s graphics) to visualize relationships among top 10 producers of top produced food cereal and among top 10 producers of top produced feed milk in terms of partial correlations among each countries’ trend in yearly production totals. (Only used 10 countries for each graphic due to poster's size constraint.) 

• Objective of graphics was to ask: "Do correlations between countries' food/feed production reveal any meaningful relationships?"


Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production or by downloading FAO.csv directly above, which is necessary to run the code.

The network diagrams and the code for them are above, the former in the .png files and latter in RMarkdown file.

The final poster that our team presented can be accessed above as well.
