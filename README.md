# Worldwide-Food-and-Feed-Production
Statistical Graphics Poster Project | 36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization | Spring 2018

•	Analyzed as team of 4 a dataset of world food/feed production from 1961-2013 with 60+ variables and 21,478 observations through graphics in order to report key insights on poster for public presentation to faculty members. 

•	Devised partial correlation network diagrams (25% of project’s graphics) with R’s qgraph package to visualize relationships among top 10 producers of top produced food cereal and among top 10 producers of top produced feed milk in terms of similarity level among each countries’ yearly production totals over time for each. (Only used 10 countries for each diagram due to poster's size constraint.) 

For the diagrams, line thickness indicates strength of relationship (partial correlation), and green indicates positive and red indicates negative.
Objective was to ask: "Do correlations between countries' food/feed production reveal any meaningful relationships?". I was interested in seeing if partial correlations among countries mapped in any way to their geographic separation.


Dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production or by downloading FAO.csv directly above, which is necessary to run the code.

Network diagrams and the code for them are above, the former in the .png files and latter in RMarkdown file.

Final poster that our team presented can be accessed above as well.
